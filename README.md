## Project Overview

This project consists of two Python scripts:

- **Composer**: Creates a data file from a video.
- **Orchestra**: Converts this data file into a .mid file for playback.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install audiolazy
pip install pandas
pip install mapping
pip install midutil
pip install numpy
pip install python-opencv
pip install --upgrade dbus-python


# Configuration Parameters

Fine-tune your settings with these file parameters:

- **frames_per_second**: Determine how many frames from the video you want to capture per second.
- **quadrants**: Divide the video into parts; for example, setting it to 3 results in 9 quadrants.
- **desired_duration**: Choose to capture only a specific portion of the video if you prefer.
- **note_names**: We're using a set of musical notes, and there are two more examples included. Feel free to create your own.

## Attention

In case you encounter an error related to audiolazy, you'll need to make adjustments to the following files with the updated version of collections:

from collections import deque
from collections.abc import Sequence, Iterable

File: Python311\site-packages\audiolazy\lazy_core.py
from collections.abc import Iterable


File: Python311\site-packages\audiolazy\lazy_stream.py
from collections.abc import Iterable
from collections import deque

File: Python311\site-packages\audiolazy\lazy_misc.py
